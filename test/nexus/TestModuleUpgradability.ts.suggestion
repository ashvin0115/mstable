// We should test the Nexus upgrading the various modules to understand the limitations and ensure that we have the
// capacity to give certain requires permissions to new parts of the system (i.e. minting and burning privs)
// Also consider what happens to 'exiled' parts of the system with remaining permissions.



// TEST -> Adding a module that does not inherit ModuleSub should not be a catastrophic event. i.e. we should be able to remove
// it from the system and act as normal again
